\chapter{Introduction}
This project presents a formalization of Gr√∂bner basis theory in the Lean 4 theorem prover, establishing the mathematical infrastructure required for automated algebraic reasoning. By constructing certified implementations of fundamental algorithms and theorems, we aim to bridge the gap between computational algebra and interactive theorem proving.
